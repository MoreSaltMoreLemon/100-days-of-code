##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 0: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Personal Portfolio Site

**Thoughts**: Working through the Intro to Gatsby tutorial and appreciating just how impressive all the work that has gone into Gatsby and the technologies it draws from are. First introduction to Emotion, and first use of GraphQL queries, and it's all amazing. However it completely overshoots what I need for a simple static site that can be coded up with very little JS. I'll need to decide just what I want to do, as it's looking like total overkill.

**Goals for Tomorrow**: Lay out HTML skeleton, develop style guide and pencil in content.
